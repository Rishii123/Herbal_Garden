# Virtual Herbal Garden

Welcome to the **Virtual Herbal Garden**! This project is an interactive web application that allows users to explore, learn about, and interact with a wide variety of medicinal plants in a virtual 3D environment.

## 🌱 About the Project

- Bookmark favorite plants and save personal notes
- Search for plants by category or medicinal use
